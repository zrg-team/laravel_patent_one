export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=ap-northeast-1
```

### Create S3 bucket to store tfstate
To store tfstate at S3, we need to create S3 bucket.

### Confirm tfvars
Some variables are set at "terraform.tfvars" and it needs to be checked before running terraform.
To generate passport public key and private key we need to run this command

### Please replace <<PLACEHOLDER>> with the appropriate value.
Finding <<PLACEHOLDER>> in the codebase and replace it with the appropriate value.

```
php artisan passport:keys
```

```
database_password = "XXXX"
master_key = "base64:XXXX"
docker_username = "XXX"
docker_password = "XXXX"
github_token = "XXXXX"
app_key = "base64:XXXXX"
passport_private_key = <<EOT
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
XXXXX
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----
EOT
passport_public_key = <<EOT
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
XXXXX
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
EOT
```

## Usage

## Memos
- We aren't managing DNS on terraform currently.
- We're not using workspace feature for switching environment (staging / production), because it's for testing according to [the official document](https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/workspaces.html#when-to-use-multiple-workspaces).
- See [the official best practices](https://www.terraform-best-practices.com/) to keep this project clean and simple.
